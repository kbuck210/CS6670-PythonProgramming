query:sheep and flower
Performing AND search for: {'flower', 'sheep'}
Found at 31 For millions of years flowers have been producing thorns. For millions of years sheep have been eating them all the same. And it's not serious, trying to understand why flowers go to such trouble to produce thorns that are good for nothing? It's not important, the war between the sheep and the flowers? It's no more serious and more important than the numbers that fat red gentleman is adding up? Suppose I happen to know a unique flower, one that exists nowhere in the world except on my planet, one that a little sheep can wipe out in a single bite one morning, just like that, without even realizing what he'd doing - that isn't important? If someone loves a flower of which just one example exists among all the millions and millions of stars, that's enough to make him happy when he looks at the stars. He tells himself 'My flower's up there somewhere...' But if the sheep eats the flower, then for him it's as if, suddenly, all the stars went out. And that isn't important?

Found at 10 If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers...
Found at 25 The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists.

Found at 38 I ought not to have listened to her,' he confided to me one day. 'One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace.
Found at 44 Of course, I love you,' the flower said to him. 'If you were not aware of it, it was my fault.
Found at 47 You know...my flower...I'm responsible for her. And she's so weak! And so naive. She has four ridiculous thorns to defend her against the world...
Found at 58 "What a queer planet!" he thought. "It is altogether dry, and altogether pointed, and altogether harsh and forbidding. And the people have no imagination. They repeat whatever one says to them . . . On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak . . .
Found at 59 I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of consequence!' And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man - he is a mushroom!
Found at 71 But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.
Found at 77 If someone loves a flower of which just one exists among all the millions and millions of stars, that's enough to make him happy when he looks at the stars.
Found at 79 Will you draw me a sheep?
Found at 81 If you love a flower that lives on a star, then it's good at night, to look up at the sky. All the stars are blossoming.

## First Iteration: Looping line by line through data list using ‘in’ keyword, searching
## each line for each search token using the find() function to return the index of the
## token. For AND searches, if all tokens found, print line, for OR searches, if any token
## is found, print the line. Calculate running time when completed

## Second Iteration: Pre-process the data by mapping each word to a set of line numbers it
## appears in. Once processed, the search is executed by checking each keyword against the 
## list of dictionary keys using the ‘in’ keyword. If the keyword is in the dictionary and
## performing an OR search, add all of the line number values mapped to each keyword found 
## to the resulting set.  If performing an AND search, the result set is initially
## populated with all possible lines, which is filtered by performing an ‘&’ comparison of 
## the result set with the set of line numbers on which each keyword is found.  After 
## performing an and comparison on all keywords found, the resultant set will only contain
## the line numbers that have both keywords. Calculate the running time when complete and 
## compare to the first iteration.

Search execution time (ms): 89

##  Observations ##

The execution time of the search is much faster (only 27% of the original execution time), 
largely because the search is being performed on a much smaller set of data.  As the text
in the data is comprised of phrases, not random words, it is a safe assumption that many
words within the data will be repeated.  By processing the data into a dictionary keyed on
the unique words within the data, the search engine then only has to search over the set
of keys rather than the entire set of data in order to determine all of the lines on which
any given word would appear. (using the union and intersection operators to obtain the 
results of OR and AND searches, respectively)

In Big-O notation, the algorithm in the dictionary approach is O(n) whereas the first
iteration approach of searching the entire dataset is O(n^2).
