## Modify Search to search over web crawler content:

###############
##  Task 1:  ##
###############
- Is there any better indexing criteria in the web crawler output?

I used the web page title name, as it was unique for most pages. (attempted to use the
alt-text on each image on the website, but was getting memory overruns because it was
too much dataâ€¦)

#######################
##  Task 2, 3, & 4   ##
#######################
- Implement existing indexer & searcher to index web crawler and file traverser data 
  from pickle file into shelve, then search the shelve for the user input keywords.

- Use the query string as input to the weather API, and if not returning an error, print
  the current weather.

output:
